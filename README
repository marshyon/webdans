WebDans - Ninja release

Web interface for viewing and maintaining DansGuardian log files

Alpha release

Whilst barely working, the interface may already be used to summarise 
log files by IP address, denied, posts and gets

Client Side :

Uses Jquery plugin 'tablesorter', JQuery ajax calls and other trickery to 
try to make the experience of reading DansGuardian logs as straight forward 
and pleasant as is reasonably possible

Server Side :

Based upon Catalyst framework using Template Toolkit 

This part is written taking a lot of short cuts and currently suffers
from hard coded pathin issues and does not at all use templating to 
the full.

The emphasis is here on getting the client side working as quickly
and painlessly as possible - taking just over 2 days to complete to this
stage.

The author is somewhat new to JQuery, relatively new to Catalyst but 
not new to Perl, so is aware of many coding improvements required of
the Catalyst application.

named after the book : JQuery from Novice to Ninja
